# Autonomous Code Generation Without Human Oversight: An Empirical Analysis of Claude Code's --dangerously-skip-permissions Command

## Research Paper Overview

**Author:** Harshith Vaddiparthy  
**Status:** In Development  
**Target:** arXiv Submission

## Abstract

This paper presents the first empirical analysis of autonomous code generation capabilities enabled by Claude Code's `--dangerously-skip-permissions` command. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate how this feature enables AI agents to generate complete software projects without human intervention, measuring performance gains, automation effectiveness, and implications for software development workflows.

## The Core Experiment: Automated Web App Generator

### What The Experiment Does
1. **Input:** Simple natural language descriptions of web applications
2. **Process:** Claude Code automatically generates complete projects using `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
3. **Output:** Fully functional web applications with all necessary files and documentation
4. **Measurement:** Performance comparison between permission-required vs autonomous modes

### How It Works
- Python script orchestrates the entire process
- Runs identical tasks with and without permission prompts
- Measures time, files created, lines of code, and user interruptions
- Generates statistical analysis and visualizations

### The Script Will Do
```python
# 1. Baseline Test: Run Claude with normal permissions
# 2. Autonomous Test: Run Claude with --dangerously-skip-permissions
# 3. Metrics Collection:
#    - Execution time comparison
#    - Number of permission prompts bypassed
#    - Files and directories created
#    - Total lines of code generated
#    - Error rates and success rates
# 4. Visualization: Generate charts showing performance differences
```

### Expected Output
- **Working Web Applications:** Multiple functional projects (todo app, blog, e-commerce)
- **Performance Data:** 5-10x speed improvement in autonomous mode
- **Statistical Analysis:** Charts and graphs proving efficiency gains
- **Documentation:** Complete logs of all operations performed
